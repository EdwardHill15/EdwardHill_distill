I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute and an instructor 
in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology track in the OHSU Department of
Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (BCB/DMICE). My research focus is on the Systems Biology of Complex Diseases. I use integrative modeling approaches across OMICs types to achieve this.

Over my twelve years of bioinformatics experience, I have experience in the low-level preprocessing of many OMICs types, including expression (especially alternative splicing), phosphoproteomics, proteomics and genomics. My experience in functional genomics has led me to use models such as Graphical Models and Networks to integrate these many OMICs types into building a unified picture of integrated systems-level dysregulation in complex diseases such as alcoholism and cancer. 

**My research interests:**

+  Heterogeneity of Cancer and Measurement using Flow Cytometry Methods
+  Systems Biology of Cancer, especially oncogenic collaboration
+  Prioritization of Combination Therapies in the treatment of cancer
+  Integrating multi-OMICs data to understand dysregulation in cancer
+  Modeling Disease using Graphical Models and Agent-Based Models
+  Interactive visualization of Data

**My teaching and mentoring interests:**

+ [R-Bootcamp](https://www.coursesites.com/s/_Rbootcamp) - an online MOOC for teaching the basics of data manipulation in R (Coursesites registration required)
+ [BioDSP](http://biodsp.slack.com) - Bioinformatics for Students and Postdocs - a discussion group at OHSU that focuses on practical skills (documentation, software engineering) necessary for success.
+ Systems Science and Modeling.

**Software Development:**

+ [surrogateMutation](https://github.com/laderast/surrogateMutation) - a package for detecting oncogenic collaboration in somatic mutation and copy nubmer data.
+ [surrogateShiny](https://github.com/laderast/surrogateShiny) - an R/Shiny Framework for exploring oncogenic collaboration in breast cancer cell lines. [See it in action.](https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/surrogateShiny/)
+ [Consense](https://github.com/laderast/surrogateMutation) - a package for comparing clustering methods.
+ [ExonModelStrain](https://github.com/laderast/ExonModelStrain) - a package for detecting alternative exon usage in the Affymetrix Exon Array
+ [TandTRAQ]() - Perl Script for merging iTRAQ and XTandem Results.
