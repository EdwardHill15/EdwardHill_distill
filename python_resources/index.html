<h2 id="in-medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology-dmice">In Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE)</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-to-programming-no-course-number">Introduction to Programming (no course number)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor: Lisa Karstens, Ph.D.</strong></li>
<li><strong>0.0 credits</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/IntroductionToProgramming-Syllabus-WI18.pdf">Course Syllabus</a></li>
<li>Offered: Winter and Summer Quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>This non-credit, online course will introduce the beginning programmer to programming structure and design, creating a solid foundation for all types of programming. The emphasis will be on procedural programming and control structures, although exercises will be in Python. The course fulfills the prerequisite for BMI 540 and BMI 565. Tuition fee is $500.</p>

<p>Students may register during the regular winter and summer term registration periods. Contact Diane Doctor for details at doctord@ohsu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="bioinformatics-programming-and-scripting-bmi-565-656">Bioinformatics Programming and Scripting - BMI 565 / 656</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor: Michael Mooney, Ph.D.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Credits: 3.0</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/BMI-565-Syllabus-FA17.pdf">Syllabus</a></li>
<li>Offered: Fall Quarter</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this course is to equip research scientists with computational skills necessary to create and automate tools to analyze biological data.  The course is divided into four sub-topics: python programming, scripting in unix, biopython library, bioinformatics workflows.  Python will be used used to solve simple to sophisticated programming problems and to review general computational language paradigms such as problem abstraction, data types, file I/O, iteration, functions, and objects.  There will also be an emphasis on writing unix operating system shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks and connect disparate bioinformatics tools using files and pipes.  In addition, students will learn to access public repositories to perform basic bioinformatics tasks such as annotating gene products, sequence searching, and functional queries. This course is designed to be a first year requirement for students in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology graduate program in Biomedical Informatics. Open to other students with consent of instructor.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Background must include an introductory programming class including concepts such as variables, loops, I/O, methods, and algorithms.</p>

<h2 id="computer-science-and-electrical-engineering-cs-ee-python-courses">Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (CS/EE) Python Courses</h2>

<h3 id="data-science-programming-cs-527-627">Data Science Programming - CS 527 / 627</h3>

<p><a href="http://cslu.ohsu.edu/~kain/CS627/">Course Website</a></p>

<p>This course is designed to give you awareness and initial working knowledge of some of the most fundamental computational tools for performing a wide variety of academic research. As such, it will focus on providing breadth instead of depth, which means that for each concept we will talk about motivation, key concepts, and concrete usage scenarios, but without mathematical background or proofs, which can be acquired in more specialized classes. In this class we will: become familiar with the UNIX/LINUX environment, learn how to version control files with git, write programs inpython, perform numeric tasks using numpy and scipy, analyze data using pandas, apply machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, visualize data using matplotlib and pyqtgraph, use QT/pyside to build graphical user interfaces, and finally we will address performance issues via compilation/profiling/parallelization tools.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-image-processing-ee-584-684">Introduction to Image Processing EE 584 / 684</h3>

<p>This course covers basic image processing principles and techniques with a brief introduction to machine vision. Specific topics include image transform methods, image filtering, image enhancement, image restoration, segmentation, image representation and feature extraction, image recognition and classification, and image compression. Application of these techniques is illustrated in numerous examples. Pre-requisite: probability and statistics or equivalent, calculus, linear algebra and proficiency in at least one high-level programming language.</p>

<h3 id="data-visualization-cs-631">Data Visualization CS 631</h3>

<p>This course will give students a foundation in the principles of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data, as well as provide students with hands-on experience using modern software tools for developing visualizations. Lecture topics will include an overview of visual perception, color theory and practice, different types of graphs and their purposes, visualizations for specialized forms of data including time-series and geospatial data sets, strategies for working with multidimensional data, etc. There will also be lecture content on ethical issues surrounding data visualization. Weekly lab sessions will introduce students to popular data visualization tools such as R&rsquo;s ggplot and Shiny, Tableau, etc.</p>

<h2 id="datacamp">DataCamp</h2>

<p>NEUS640 Students will have access to DataCamp for the next 6 months.</p>
