      <description>As part of my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution to learn new things about R, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to plug some holes in my R knowledge by writing more vignettes to explain them to myself this year.
This week I finally think I understand more about namespaces in R and why you should use them in your R package.
Namespaces: Why Bother? In short, we need namespaces because of the ambiguity of function names.</description>

      <description>Well, we just finished our clinical data wrangling workshop. This was a 12 hour workshop (spread over 4 days) where students got to work with a real research dataset (the Sleep Heart Health Study data). This is a workshop that we developed as part of an National Library of Medicine T15 training supplement in Data Science. The following is a short report describing the workshop and its outcomes.
Intended AudienceWe designed the workshop for our incoming informatics students (both clinical and biological majors) in order to introduce them to the difficulties of working with clinical data.</description>

      <description>I just gave a workshop teaching the basics of Shiny (the interactive web visualization framework) for a group of PDX R users. We had 10 people attend, and most of the attendees managed to get through the material and had lots of good questions. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and I hope everyone learned something. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to give the workshop again to the larger PDX R user community, and some of the attendees last night have volunteered to be TAs.</description>
