      <description>Note: after posting this, I heard back from Roberto Tyler, the creator of the BFG. I&amp;rsquo;d like to note that the BFG actually does its job really well. I was mostly really frustrated about how Git/GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent a user from doing something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. So my frustration is really about that, not really about the BFG. This post has been edited to reflect that.
Greg Wilson first said it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to agree.</description>
