      <description>I just gave a workshop teaching the basics of Shiny (the interactive web visualization framework) for a group of PDX R users. We had 10 people attend, and most of the attendees managed to get through the material and had lots of good questions. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and I hope everyone learned something. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to give the workshop again to the larger PDX R user community, and some of the attendees last night have volunteered to be TAs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a talk for the PDX RLang Meetup on July 11 called &amp;ldquo;How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data: Teaching EDA using Shiny&amp;rdquo;. Abstract below.
Many graduate students in the basic sciences are afraid of data exploration and cleaning, which can greatly impact their downstream analysis results. By using a synthetic dataset, some simple dplyr commands, and a shiny dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units).</description>
