      <description>This term, I&amp;rsquo;m co-teaching an undergraduate course for the PSU/OHSU School of Public Health called Health Informatics with a number of my collegues in my department, including Bill Hersh, Eilis Boudreau, Karen Eden, and Virginia Lankes. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to give students a feel for what informatics is about in an accessible way.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make the lectures as understandable as I can. This week we tackled Genome Wide Association Studies and discussed the strength of evidence behind SNP variants associated with phenotypes.</description>
