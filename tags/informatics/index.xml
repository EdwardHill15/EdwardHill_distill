      <description>Sorry for the lack of posts. I have been busy with co-teaching our Health Informatics course (HSMP410) for the OHSU/PSU School of Public Health.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make most of my lectures activity-driven for my students, who are Community Health Education and Nursing majors. I believe that you can teach mathematical concepts visually, so I am experimenting with using LearnR/Shiny to teach the basics of data literacy. I&amp;rsquo;m also using datacamp-light to show my students a simple intro to data science.</description>

      <description>Course material I have been developing for PHE427, Health Informatics. This is a course that is co-taught with Bill Hersh for the OHSU/PSU School of Public Health. They are intended for students with very little math and programming background. Where possible, Iâ€™ve tried to have hands-on activities for each of the subjects.</description>
