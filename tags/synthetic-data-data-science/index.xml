      <description>Hi Everyone, our paper called Teaching data science fundamentals through realistic synthetic clinical cardiovascular data is now available to read on Biorxiv.
In this paper, we talk about a dataset that we synthesized for teaching aspects of clinical data that may be tricky to understand in data science. This dataset is interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.</description>
