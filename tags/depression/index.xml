      <description>Last year about this time, I had a meltdown, which is a symptom of burnout. I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain a little bit about my burnout in the hopes that other people can avoid it.
I want to help people, and I’m a people pleaser. I’m a giver, and sometimes I give too much, to the point I have nothing left. I have to be aware when people exploit this. One collaboration, unfortunately took advantage of my giving nature.</description>
