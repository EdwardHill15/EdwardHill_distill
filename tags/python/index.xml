      <description>Well, the week of teaching our Python Bootcamp for Neuroscientists is over. I had the pleasure of working with a great group of students, professors and instructors in developing the material, and had a great time teaching complete beginners to programming and Python.
We had the overall goal of introducting 21 Neuroscience Graduate Program students at OHSU to the basics of programming in Python using data that they were interested in: electrophysiology data, and confocal microscopy data.</description>
