      <description>I gave a talk for the Portland State University Systems Science seminar called How are Data Science and Systems Science Connected?. In this talk, I was highlighting current blind spots in Data Science that I think Systems Science approaches can address, especially that of interactions between features. I talked a little about my dissertation research (surrogate oncogenes), and the problem of black-box interpretability of predictive models.
