      <description>I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology at OHSU (BCB/DMICE) and a member of the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute. My research focus is on the Systems Biology of Complex Diseases. I use integrative modeling approaches across OMICs types to achieve this.
With over fourteen years of bioinformatics experience, I have developed methods for low-level preprocessing and high-level analysis of many OMICs types, including expression (especially alternative splicing), phosphoproteomics, proteomics, and genomics.</description>

      <description>1. What is a good enough timeframe to complete something? Look at the data sources required to pull this together.
1. What do I need to know about working with you? I am clinically depressed and have anxiety, but I am high-functioning. I do my best to meet deadlines, but sometimes there is a lot on my plate and I need to manage my anxiety and depression.
The number one thing is that last minute deadlines are a significant stress on my anxiety and affect me very negatively.</description>
