      <description>I decided to write this post in celebration of my newest album, [Tiny Fugues, being released](). I consider myself a scientist and I am a musician in almost equal parts. There has been a lot of talking about the role of creativity in science. Honestly, I rarely try to cross the streams of science and music, mostly because it really hasn&amp;rsquo;t been encouraged in my career.
I do think that I do use the same problem solving skills that I do in science that I also use in composition.</description>
