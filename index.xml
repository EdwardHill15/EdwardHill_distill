&lt;p&gt;Well, RStudio Conf 2019 has come and gone. I attended the main conference, starting with the poster session on wednesday and stayed through the tidyverse developer day on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that it was inspiring was an understatement. So many talented people working on such interesting and inspiring packages! It made me excited again about doing data science and teaching data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is going to highlight the interesting talks about education and organizational management at the conference. There were lots of thought provoking talks and great resources about education. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the other resources, posters, and talks&lt;/a&gt; (thanks, Karl Broman!). There are a lot of new neat whiz bag features in RStudio, which I won&amp;rsquo;t cover, but are covered very well by others at Karl&amp;rsquo;s link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;available-teaching-resources&#34;&gt;Available Teaching Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was much sharing of educational resources. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Howe (Director of Education for RStudio) presented a number of resources that RStudio is providing for educational purposes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/learning-r-survey/blob/master/slides/Next-Million-R-Users.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Their goal is to train the next million R users&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some of the RStudio based educational resources that might be useful for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RStudio Cloud is now available free for people who teach courses&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/pricing/academic-pricing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;who can send them a course syllabus to gain access&lt;/a&gt;. RStudio Cloud includes resources to make coursework publically or privately available, allows instructors to install default packages, and gives students an immediate way to start playing with R/RStudio. We are definitely going to use this in teaching our &lt;a href=&#34;http://laderast.github.io/AnalyticsCourse&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BMI &lt;sup&gt;569&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;669&lt;/sub&gt; Data Analytics&lt;/a&gt; course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel also has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://datasciencebox.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Data Science In a Box&lt;/a&gt; course available that can be forked and used by anyone. There is a great discussion of how to use the course and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasciencebox.org/hello/tech-stack/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tech stack (RStudio Cloud, GitHub, and Slack)&lt;/a&gt; needed to make the course runnable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also a number of LearnR Tutorials built into RStudio Cloud called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio-education/primers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio Primers&lt;/a&gt; that cover a lot of basic RStudio operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2019-rstudioconf/poster_laderast.png&#34; alt=&#34;Democratizing Data Science using LearnR and Shiny&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Minnier and I &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/equal_viz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;presented at the poster session&lt;/a&gt; about our LearnR tutorials, &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/laderast/DSIExplore&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DSIExplore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/laderast/dataLiteracyTutorial&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dataLiteracyTutorial&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&#34;http://laderast.github.io/burro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;burro&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package, which lets &lt;a href=&#34;http://tladeras.shinyapps.io/nhanes_explore&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;users explore a new dataset with a simplified Shiny App&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s even a function that lets you build a shiny app from a dataset that you can publish to a Shiny server such as &lt;code&gt;shinyapps.io&lt;/code&gt; or RStudio Connect for sharing and having a &lt;a href=&#34;https://laderast.github.io/burro/articles/data_scavenger_hunt.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data scavenger hunt&lt;/a&gt; together. Or as Angela Bassa calls it, an EDA Party. Whoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really loved Irene Stevens&amp;rsquo; talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/isteves/teaching-data-science-with-puzzles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Teaching Data Science Using Puzzles&lt;/a&gt;. Irene and Jenny Bryan put together a simple project-based framework that lets students download simple data wrangling puzzles per week, lets them submit their answer to an answer server and get feedback, and when they solve it, it creates a minimal reproducible example (reprex) to share with their puzzle community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly Bodwin gave a presentation of how she used Shiny apps as an intermediate step as part of an approach to &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.calpoly.edu/~kbodwin/RStudio_2019.html#1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;teaching introductory statistics&lt;/a&gt;. Kelly is of the opinion that coding is good even for non majors, and her Shiny apps provide an intermediate step between a more click-based app and coding, asking the students to input their variables, their hypothesis, and highlights the output that results. I really liked this approach. I also really loved this slide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2019-rstudioconf/downloads_folder.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;diversity-and-inclusiveness-make-for-better-data-science&#34;&gt;Diversity and Inclusiveness Make for Better Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Jesse Mostipak&amp;rsquo;s talk about her data science journey starting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfordatasci.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R For Data Science (R4DS)&lt;/a&gt; learning community. She especially emphasized that data science was her path out of lower incomes and that she thought it needs to be more accessible to all. She talked about the barriers to going from &amp;ldquo;Using your computer for Netflix&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Using your computer for data science&amp;rdquo; as real, and what she learned as a community manager for the R4DS learning community. Finally, she ended with a call for data scientists to share their mistakes, in order to model that making mistakes is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mistakes, Caitlin Hudon gave a talk called &amp;ldquo;Learning from Eight Years of Data Science Mistakes&amp;rdquo;, which was really helpful. One of her messages was that &amp;ldquo;Mistakes count as experience&amp;rdquo;, and learning from past mistakes is extremely helpful for the whole team. However, it must be safe for team members to share their mistakes, and so creating the right culture of respect and teaching is important. This includes documentation, and including pseudocode next to the actual code to talk non-data scientists through is important. Likewise, making sure that you are solving the correct business problem requires communication. I really liked her discussion of the Rhetorical Triangle as a way to frame communications: Speaker, Audience, and Context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracy Teal from Data Carpentries also talked about their efforts to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yZTOcm0hO3sq8nz24luNoxL2Tk4IWfwoeYSXa09-zB8/edit#slide=id.g4d9835a148_0_218&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Teaching R using inclusive pedagogy&lt;/a&gt;, including fostering a growth mindset. &lt;a href=&#34;https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Their instructor training&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful 2-day crash course in teaching, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to propose that it be offered to our graduate students to prep them for teaching. (Full disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to these course materials.) I also appreciated how candid she was about how much further they need to go to increase the diversity of participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity and Inclusiveness was also a theme of Angela Bassa&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/angelabassa/rstudioconf-2019&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Team Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. She pointed out that data science teams need to be diverse to serve audiences who are highly diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-teaching-resources-for-community-college-instructors&#34;&gt;Making Teaching Resources for Community College Instructors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really interesting talk for me was Mary Rudis&amp;rsquo; talk about her work &lt;a href=&#34;https://mrshrbrmstr.github.io/RStudioConf2019/pres/Marys_slides-rev/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;teaching data science at the community college level&lt;/a&gt;. As head of the math department at Penn State Harrisburg, Mary has done a lot of work developing the first data science certification at the community college level. There are a lot more people attending community college than 4 year colleges, and we need to make paths to data science accessible for these students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot more work needs to be done to make data science accessible at this level. Mary has pointed out a number of efforts that need help, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://statprep.org/the-statprep-team/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;StatPREP&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amatyc.site-ym.com/page/AMATYCAffiliateOrg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges&lt;/a&gt;. She also ended with a call for Shiny Developers to help Community College instructors develop tools they can use to teach data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;organizational-considerations-in-data-science&#34;&gt;Organizational Considerations in Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational considerations were also a really interesting part of RStudio Conf for me. Joe Cheng&amp;rsquo;s keynote on &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/shiny-in-production&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shiny in Production&lt;/a&gt; spent some time talking about overcoming resistance to Shiny in your organization, including talking with Data Engineers and IT Security. His point was that oftentimes, resistance comes from the feelings of territorialism and how to overcome them. Tonya Filz also gave a talk about being a Resilient R Champion at your organization, stressing these issues and giving us case studies/examples to show leaders at your organization. (These slides weren&amp;rsquo;t posted yet, I will update this post when they are.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilary Parker&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/rstudioconf2019l&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Creativity and Data Science in the Organization&lt;/a&gt;, about applying system design principles to data science. Rather than thinking of ourselves as having a traditional role at the end of the analysis, Hilary suggested that we partipate in all parts of the process, including data collection. Her group suggested a change in an app, which resulted in a brand new data stream for them to analyse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela Bassa&amp;rsquo;s Talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/angelabassa/rstudioconf-2019&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Team Data Science&lt;/a&gt; talked about the organizational aspects of making a data team, including specializing roles, making sure that knowledge and expertise was distributed, and managing burnout by making sure that no one team member is overloaded. She stressed resilience within a team by making sure that people are taking care of themselves, having redundancy in the team. Process is also important, by making sure data is well documented, by allotting time. She also stressed the importance of young and new data scientists to the team, because they aren&amp;rsquo;t biased with previous knowledge. I also thought she had excellent arguments about the cost of &lt;em&gt;not expanding&lt;/em&gt; your data team - potential users who would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;encouraging-a-growth-mindset&#34;&gt;Encouraging a Growth Mindset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the final panel discussion, which was about encouraging a Growth Mindset for Data Scientists in their careers. Karthik Ram, Tracy Teal, Angela Bassa, and Hilary Parker all fielded questions about growing as a data scientist. One of my favorite remarks was from Tracy Teal, who mused about the possibility of a Leadership Carpentry, teaching potential leaders essential skills such as mentoring, faciliation skills, and valuing team contributions. Angela Bassa also had a great quote that &amp;ldquo;leadership is programming people&amp;rdquo;. She also pointed out that the role of Data Scientists is to &amp;ldquo;Question Dogma&amp;rdquo; and pointed out the importance of saying &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2019-rstudioconf/public_work.png&#34; alt=&#34;Making your work public&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth mindset was also a theme of Dave Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Keynote, which was about making your &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/drob-rstudio-2019&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data science work public at a number of levels&lt;/a&gt;. He outlined a number of different types of public contributions, such as short form (tweets, discussions about data), long form (blogs), code contributions, and even writing a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;direct-explicit-instruction-in-education&#34;&gt;Direct Explicit Instruction in Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felienne Hermans gave a wonderful keynote about teaching computer programming. Part of her point was that programming pedagogy is dominated by the &amp;ldquo;[tyranny of fun]()&amp;ldquo;, rather than focusing on teaching fundamentals. One of the problems with programming education is that we haven&amp;rsquo;t defined what these fundamentals are, compared to the pedagogy of reading, which talks about teaching with fundamentals such as phonics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect students to explore things without teaching them enough, and that actually hurts their progress. Instead, we should also be teaching fundamentals, such as code reading out loud and rote memorization of programming patterns. By utilizing these fundamentals, she has found improved learning outcomes. As she says, motivation comes from seeing progress, not necessarily from exploration alone. Her results on using direct instruction have showed improved outcomes in terms of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that this talk really opened my eyes to the blind spots we have in programming education. Looking forward to incorporating these ideas in my coursework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-many-people-to-teach-so-many-ways-to-teach&#34;&gt;So Many People to Teach, So Many Ways to Teach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my summary about the education and organizational talks/posters at RStudio Conf. Hopefully it gives you an idea of what resources, opportunities, and pedagogy is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reframing Impostor Syndrome as the Road to Mastery</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;At some point in your life in Data Science, you will probably struggle with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. We all do - in fact, even though I have used R and have done bioinformatics and data science for more than 15 years, I still struggle with this feeling. As a beginner, the mountain you must climb to master skills in data science seems like a long and impossible one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Hudon, in her post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/01/19/imposter-syndrome-in-data-science/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dealing with impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about countering impostor syndrome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome is this: I’ve accepted that I will never be able to learn everything there is to know in data science — I will never know every algorithm, every technology, every cool package, or even every language — and that’s okay. The great thing about being in such a diverse field is that nobody will know all of these things (and that’s okay too!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to try and reframe the feelings of impostor syndrome into something more positive. I think having self-compassion about the difficulties of the learning process can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Leonard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81940.Mastery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mastery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a short book that I think can help provide the antidote to these feelings of fraud and inadequacy. I feel that beginners and learners would feel much better if their instructors would own up to their own personal shortcomings as learners. That is, instead of trying to project the image of the all knowledgable guru, instructors should show themselves as humble, lifelong learners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81940.Mastery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mastery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Leonard talks about our unrealistic expectations and how these expectations can get in the way of actually learning and mastering a craft. We are conditioned by ads, movies, and social media that mastering a craft is a never ending set of ever rising climaxes (cue the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFCHuEegsk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;training montage&lt;/a&gt;), that we can make continuous and steady progress by working hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastering a craft takes practice, and lots of it. We must learn to be contented to practice when we are on a plateau and are not making visible progress. As Leonard notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Path to Mastery is practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard outlines 5 principles that can sustain us in our road to mastery and away from impostor syndrome: &lt;strong&gt;Instruction&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Surrender&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Intentionality&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Edge&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to map common feelings of impostor syndrome and show how these principles can counteract these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instruction&lt;/strong&gt;. Leonard emphasizes the importance in finding good instructors and good mentorship that will help us to grow. Finding good instructors can actually be difficult and finding someone who remembers what it was like to be learning something is important. Avoid those instructors who say things like &amp;ldquo;it should now be obvious&amp;rdquo; or are disparaging when you don&amp;rsquo;t understand something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He or she is not necessarily the one that gives the most polished lectures, but rather the &lt;em&gt;one who has discovered how to involve each student actively&lt;/em&gt; in the process of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you can do today&lt;/em&gt;: look at twitter and other forums for your community of learners and support those who give good instruction. Realize that not all teachers are good teachers; leave them and seek better ones if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;. Practice for practices&amp;rsquo; sake. Deliberate practice where you slowly build up your understanding and perceptions is important to your growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where in our upbringing, our schooling, our career are we taught to value, to enjoy, even to love the plateau, the long stretch of diligent effort with no seeming progress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you can do today&lt;/em&gt;: Join communities of practice such as Tidy Tuesday and share your learning with others. Tidy Tuesday is extremely friendly and encouraging for beginners. Learn together and grow together. These are safe communities to share knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intentionality&lt;/strong&gt;. This goes hand in hand with practice. Deliberate practice requires visualizing your process and guiding yourself gently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentionality fuels the master&amp;rsquo;s journey. Every master is a master of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you can do today&lt;/em&gt;: find small exercises and projects that help you reinforce what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far. Find people&amp;rsquo;s code and vignettes and modify them until you understand what they&amp;rsquo;ve done and how they structured their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender&lt;/strong&gt;. At some point, you will have to give up your own social position as an expert to grow as a learner. When this happens, you must be willing to risk that standing to progress further. Leonard talks about a karate master learning aikido who was not willing to start from scratch, which impeded his learning. For many of us academics, being willing to abandon the comfort of what we have learned is especially difficult. We feel like we are risking our own social standing and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the master, surrender means there are no experts. There are only Learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you can do today&lt;/em&gt;: be humble when faced with new concepts (for many impostor syndrome sufferers this is not the hard part). Recognize when you need to grow and when you have to leave old concepts behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Edge&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where things are undefined and scary. Still, part of the journey to mastery is a willingness to push your thoughts to beyond the horizon of what you thought was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick here is not only to test the edges of the envelope, but also to walk the fine line between endless, goalless practice and those alluring roles that appear along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you can do today&lt;/em&gt;: Identify some goals that are just beyond your current skillset and be willing to push your learning to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard maintains that true mastery is not due to innate talent. True mastery is due to tenacity and perserverance in the face of difficult learning. In fact, he suggests that learning things too easily means that you might lack perserverance when the going gets rough and your progress slows. He maintains that someone who perseveres will &amp;ldquo;have learned whatever [they] are practicing to the marrow of [their] bones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;encouraging-mastery-as-a-community&#34;&gt;Encouraging Mastery as a Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Caitlin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/01/19/imposter-syndrome-in-data-science/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;prescriptions for community wide suggestions for reducing impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; are wonderful. Especially the advice to &amp;ldquo;Get comfortable with I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. Normalizing &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; within a community is incredibly important to making a psychologically safe learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To encourage learners, I think that creating a community of practice and helpfulness is vitally important to give new learners the support they need. When communities take responsibility for the learning of their members, something magic happens. Learning no longer feels lonely and there is no shame when you don&amp;rsquo;t immediately grasp a concept. Patience becomes the norm and people become more confident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the true value of schools and universities. To get the most out of online learning, you need to participate within a community that encourages you to learn further. Be on the pathway to mastery by participate within learning communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things we learned teaching clinical data wrangling</title>
      <link>/2018/10/15/clinical-data-wrangling/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/10/15/clinical-data-wrangling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, we just finished our &lt;a href=&#34;https://laderast.github.io/clinical_data_wrangling/&#34;&gt;clinical data wrangling workshop&lt;/a&gt;. This was a 12 hour workshop (spread over 4 days) where students got to work with a real research dataset (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sleepdata.org&#34;&gt;Sleep Heart Health Study&lt;/a&gt; data). This is a workshop that we developed as part of an National Library of Medicine T15 training supplement in Data Science. The following is a short report describing the workshop and its outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;intended-audience&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intended Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed the workshop for our incoming informatics students (both clinical and biological majors) in order to introduce them to the difficulties of working with clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;learning-objectives&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were our learning objectives for the workshop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the biology of sleep and sleep apnea and how the biology informs the covariates measured in the Sleep Heart Health Study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand why clinical data is useful and also why it’s difficult to work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and use them to inform model building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to assess logistic regression models using simple diagnostics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-dataset&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs&#34;&gt;Sleep Heart Health Study&lt;/a&gt; dataset from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sleepdata.org&#34;&gt;National Sleep Research Resource&lt;/a&gt;. This is a dataset of approximately 5800 patients that have over 3000 covariates. We limited our students to a smaller number of covariates (17), including our outcome of interest, cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;workshop-format&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workshop Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed the workshop to be a mix of didactic lectures and active learning exercises. Where possible, we had students work in groups to answer questions about the data. These activities included a data scavenger hunt using our EDA exploration app, and a logistic modeling exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;day-1-outline&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 1 Outline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction, logistics, and groups assigned (30 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology of Sleep and Cardiovascular Disease (40 minutes, format: in-person lecture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break Time (15 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Value of Clinical Data (15 minutes, in-person lecture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical Data Quality (40 minutes, in-person lecture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch (90 minutes, with optional R setup session)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the SHHS Dataset (60 minutes, format: Data Scavenger Hunt w/ Shiny App, each team gets a task and has to show the class how to find the information)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying the Clinical Wrangling Process: Diabetes (45 minutes, format: in-person lecture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistic Regression Model Basics (60 minutes, format: walkthrough of R Notebook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;day-2&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question/Answer session about Logistic Regression and Modeling (50 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignment about &lt;code&gt;race&lt;/code&gt; variable (assigned to groups, take-home assignment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;day-3&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion about &lt;code&gt;race&lt;/code&gt; as a covariate, sharing of findings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of hypertension and how it relates to cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template/R Notebook given for final presentation in groups (in-class lab time, template is structured as a series of decisions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;day-4&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group presentations about covariate decisions and resulting model (1 hour, present final version of R notebook). At each decision stage, teams must decide on whether or not to include covariates or not given what they have found from exploring the data and justify their decision using EDA visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we believe the workshop went well, as it encouraged discussion about data and its appropriateness among the students. Students were engaged overall and asked lots of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final reports for each group were generated from a R Notebook. All three groups showed a thoughtful narrative and justification for each of the covariates included in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive visualization removes barriers to understanding issues in data&lt;/strong&gt;. Ted developed a Shiny App that allowed the students to visually browse and understand the data. Along with the EDA scavenger hunt (see below), this served as a good introduction for students to get their feet wet with the SHHS dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our diverse backgrounds helped make the workshop accessible.&lt;/strong&gt; Nicole Weiskopf has a background in data quality of clinical data, Eilis Boudreau does sleep study work, and I’m a bit of a mongrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing the cooperation of the data holders made the workshop possible&lt;/strong&gt;. The dataset comes from the National Sleep Study Resource. Eilis knows Susan Redline, who heads that group and pitched the idea (over two sessions) to her group. Susan’s group was very enthusiastic and helpful, especially in helping the students get their data use agreements in so they could access the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group work is learning work&lt;/strong&gt;. We assigned each student to a group, and gave each group questions to answer and teach the class about the dataset. By pointing them to specific aspects of the data, we opened the door to discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDA scavenger hunt&lt;/strong&gt;. We had the students learn data exploration by giving them a scavenger hunt to look at the relationship between variables. Each group was then required to talk about their findings and which visualization helped them discover that relationship. For example, there is a relationship between age and race in our dataset; the “Other” category of race has a lower median age than the other two categories, “White” and “Black”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didactic Teaching is also important&lt;/strong&gt;. Nicole and Eilis covered both the biology of sleep apnea and the difficulty of understanding the implications of clinical data. Without this background, students would not be able to make informed decisions about their final model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide the Students, but don’t force discussion&lt;/strong&gt;. This was important. We think the students need to connect the dots to really understand the issues. The final product (a logistic regression model predicting cardiovascular disease with an R Notebook) had steps and choices. But the choices for each group of students was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Code of conduct is necessary and important&lt;/strong&gt;. We are big believers in psychological safety. If people don’t feel safe in the classroom environment (and let’s face it, grad school classrooms rarely are), they will be less likely to learn and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data restrictions made deploying difficult&lt;/strong&gt;. The activity materials were deployed as an RStudio project. However, we couldn’t share the data within a GitHub repo. As OHSU’s approved vendor is Box, we setup a box folder containing the material to be shared with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were grateful for the incoming informatics students’ enthusiasm and patience as we got this workshop going. Also thanks to the NLM T15 Supplement in Data Science, without which we would not have gotten the opportunity to conceptualize, put together, and deliver this workshop. Thanks again to Susan Redline and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sleepdata.org&#34;&gt;National Sleep Research Resource&lt;/a&gt; group, especially Dan Mobley who helped us with the last-minute data use agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning down the noise</title>
      <link>/2018/08/02/turning-down-the-noise/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the process of recovering from my current bout of depression and anxiety. I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about what is currently helping me moderate my anxiety. I have been practicing mindfulness and meditation for the past three years and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to realize how necessary it is in our information dense age. Many of my symptoms of anxiety are really from an information overglut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently on way too many projects and am teaching as well. Everything wants my attention. We need to decide dates for a visit, etc. Booking travel, grading students, etc. The noise of academic life can be overwhelming and can prevent me from working effectively. A book I&amp;rsquo;m reading, &lt;em&gt;Real Happiness at Work&lt;/em&gt; by Sharon Salzberg, talks about Attention Deficit Trait disorder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention deficit trait (ADT) is workplace-induced attention deficit caused by the constant, relentless input of information, these days usually enabled by our high-tech devices, smartphones, and computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially prevalent for people like me who are on multiple grants and have many collaborators. I&amp;rsquo;m okay with putting out the occasional fire or dealing with an emergency deadline; if I believe in the project, I can muster the energy. However, the problem is when I have multiple fires to deal with from multiple people. The task switching leads to stress and leads to an inability to prioritize. This is where I&amp;rsquo;ve been the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is when the voices of doubt begin to fuel my anxiety. On top of the enormous task list, there&amp;rsquo;s the feelings of failure and disappointment because I can&amp;rsquo;t get simple things done. In my head the voices reach a frenzy, a cacophony, a noise. And then I can&amp;rsquo;t think straight, prioritize, work on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution to ADT and the noise of life? Mindfulness and unitasking. As Sharon Salzberg notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; while it’s unrealistic to try to stop the number and variety of incoming demands, in our technologically advanced world it is possible to modulate how much information we’re taking in, and how many tasks we are doing at once. When we slow down and concentrate on doing just what is before us to be done now, &lt;strong&gt;we become the masters of our own environment rather than its frantic slaves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea (being a master of my environment) appeals to me in the midst of my academic anxiety. Practicing mindfulness (through daily meditation) helps me to focus on the here and now. We are wired to ruminated about the past (things we wish we&amp;rsquo;d done better) or the future (oh crap, I need to prepare upcoming stuff). Meditation is all about building that focus and attention on what&amp;rsquo;s before us. If we can&amp;rsquo;t do it all, we can at least work on what&amp;rsquo;s right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading Anne Lamott&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Bird by Bird&lt;/em&gt;, a book reflecting on the hows and whys of writing and living your life while doing it. It&amp;rsquo;s a sobering view of why we write and how to keep on in the face of numerous adversities. There&amp;rsquo;s one passage that really resonated with me in the chapter called &amp;ldquo;Shitty First Drafts&amp;rdquo; in dealing with the incessant chatter of life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse. Pick it up by the tail and drop it into a mason jar. Then isolate another voice, pick it up by the tail, drop it in the jar. And so on. Drop any high maintenance parental units, drop in any contractors, lawyers, colleagues, children, anyone else who is whining in your head. Then put the lid on, and watch all these mouse people clawing at the glass, jabbering away, trying to make you feel like shit because you won&amp;rsquo;t do what they want - won&amp;rsquo;t give them more money, won&amp;rsquo;t be more successful, won&amp;rsquo;t see them more often. Then imagine there is a volume control button on the bottle. Turn it all the way up for a minute, and listen to the stream of angry, neglected, guilt-mongering voices. Then turn it all the way down and watch the frantic mice lunge at the glass, trying to get to you. Leave it down, and get back to your shitty first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another idea in mindfulness: &lt;em&gt;welcoming and acknowledging our worries and negative voices&lt;/em&gt;. If we ignore or refuse these feelings, they just become stronger and louder in the din and the noise. I have all sorts of these feelings: &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t work hard enough&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a failure&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m letting down people who depend on me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Everyone is out there working on cooler things than me&lt;/em&gt;. Now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take an effort to welcome these feelings into my mental space, saying &amp;ldquo;okay, I hear you and acknowledge you, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be yelling anymore&amp;rdquo;. And surprisingly, they do quiet down. Acknowledging the feelings of failure, thanking them for their contribution to the discussion and showing them the door is important. As Kelly Boys says in &lt;em&gt;The Blind Spot Effect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you approach life with a willingness to be with what you encounter without getting lost in it, it moves gracefully within your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that helps lower the volume and free your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling generalized anxiety or attention deficit trait, I encourage you to look into mindfulness as a way of turning down the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the resources that I&amp;rsquo;ve used when writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692475389/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mindful Geek: Secular Meditation for Smart Skeptics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Taft. This is a great book for people who are interested in Mindfulness and the psychological and neuroscience research about why mindfulness works in reducing depression and anxiety. I started here. Michael Taft calls meditation &amp;ldquo;a technology for hacking the human wetware to improve your life&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Real-Happiness-Work-Meditations-Accomplishment/dp/B0182Q7KAQ/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Happiness at Work: Meditations for Accomplishment, Achievement, and Peace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Sharon Salzberg. This is a nice followup to &lt;em&gt;Mindful Geek&lt;/em&gt;, talking about how we can regain control in our workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Blind-Spot-Effect-Missing-Whats-ebook/dp/B07413Q5Y7/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blind Spot Effect: How to Stop Missing What&amp;rsquo;s Right in Front of You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Kelly Boys. I am really liking this book so far. It&amp;rsquo;s about how meditation and mindfulness can help us find our cognitive blind spots and move beyond them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Anne Lamott. I recently started reading this on vacation. Writing can be a lonely and solitary life, and I find many of her suggestions about living to apply equally well to research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A gRadual Introduction to Shiny</title>
      <link>/2018/01/24/gradual-introduction-to-shiny/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/01/24/gradual-introduction-to-shiny/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just gave a workshop teaching the basics of &lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.rstudio.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; (the interactive web visualization framework) for a group of PDX R users. We had 10 people attend, and most of the attendees managed to get through the material and had lots of good questions. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and I hope everyone learned something. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to give the workshop again to the larger PDX R user community, and some of the attendees last night have volunteered to be TAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop materials consist of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://laderast.github.io/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown document&lt;/a&gt; that can be done either in person or independently. The materials are freely available under an Apache 2.0 License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshop, we build a flexible &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt; (comma separated value) explorer that can load in &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt; data files with adaptive controls and tooltips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of packages, the workshop uses the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; (mostly &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;plotly&lt;/code&gt; to show some basic programming patterns in &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting controls to &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; aesthetics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filtering data using &lt;code&gt;reactive&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;observe&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;update_&lt;/code&gt; pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooltips (the hard way/the plotly way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love for more people to take a look at the workshop and would &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang/issues/2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;love any suggestions&lt;/a&gt; for making it better!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What We learned teaching Python to Neuroscience Students</title>
      <link>/2018/01/17/what-we-learned-teaching-python-to-neuroscience-students/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, the week of teaching our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Python Bootcamp for Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; is over. I had the pleasure of working with a great group of students, professors and instructors in developing the material, and had a great time teaching complete beginners to programming and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the overall goal of introducting 21 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/neuroscience-graduate-program/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Neuroscience Graduate Program&lt;/a&gt; students at OHSU to the basics of programming in Python using data that they were interested in: electrophysiology data, and confocal microscopy data. The course was designed to be a 1 credit course to encourage students to persist and finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format of the class was spread over 5 days (2.5 hours a day) and had the following schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to basic data types in Python&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to for loops and Pandas DataFrames&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Pandas to analyse electrophysiology data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using NumPy to analyse confocal microscopy data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of students; installing Python/Juypter; wrap-up with questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just write up some random thoughts about our experiences about the course. We are definitely planning to give the course again next year, given the enthusiastic reception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-that-really-worked-well&#34;&gt;Things that really worked well&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the first day blues of installing Python by using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JupyterHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I think one of the major pain points for beginners is installing software before they can even learn. Instead of making them install Python the first day, we had them sign into an AWS server that had JuypterHub deployed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JupyterHub is a multi-user server for Juypter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; which had the right version of Python and our need the dependencies installed. So our students just needed a laptop and a web browser to access our lessons. We could update the notebooks by pulling changes from our course repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen David, my fellow instructor, figured a lot of the difficult deployment details out. He has put together some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/blob/master/server_setup/hubInstall.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handy instructions about deploying JuypterHub to AWS&lt;/a&gt; and keeping the accounts updated via a GitHub repo in case other people are interested in using our bootcamp materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the atmosphere welcoming to beginners&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to do so, we used many great tips from Software/Data Carpentry: modeling resilience by using live coding (and making mistakes along the way), using post-it notes for students to signal when they need help or are finished, and having plenty of TAs per student (at least 4 students/TA or instructor). We tried to emphasize that learning programming is an ongoing process, and that even we still have to Google errors on Stack Overflow. Showing that you can make mistakes and still recover is a big part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan some early wins and make the exercises as interactive as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; For the most part, we tried to avoid lecturing too long and break up the session with interactive exercises. I also really don&amp;rsquo;t like workshops where the trainer/teacher moves on no matter whether people understand the material or not. By using the post-its to signal when they were done, we were able to more appropriately pace the workshop. We also planned on stopping points if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get through the day&amp;rsquo;s materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize working together and building a community.&lt;/strong&gt; From the beginning, we emphasized that everyone needed to work together. I always emphasize the chain of help: 1) First your programming partner, 2) then the TA help. Discussing and working on issues together fosters a sense of community. I think there will be a group of students who will really want to learn more because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting feedback along the way&lt;/strong&gt;. I still feel like being a teacher is about 75% preparation and 25% improvisation. You need to be flexible enough to come up with examples on the fly, and you need to evaluate whether students are getting the material along the way. The exercises we tried to sprinkle throughout the notebooks helped us understand where people were stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning follow-up sessions&lt;/strong&gt;. Through BioData Club, we&amp;rsquo;re planning some follow-up sessions. Through DataCamp in the Classroom, I also got our students premium access. We also pointed students out to &lt;a href=&#34;/python_resources/&#34;&gt;other Python-based courses at OHSU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-things-we-could-improve-on&#34;&gt;Some things we could improve on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that given our time frame, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really have anticipated many of these issues. We did our best to deal with them in the moment, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describing the difference between Jupyter Notebooks and Python&lt;/strong&gt;. At the beginning, we glossed over what a Jupyter Notebook was and really didn&amp;rsquo;t describe its relation to Python. I think next time we will open with describing the relationship between Jupyter and Python with a diagram, and revisit it on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate the JupyterHub server requirements better&lt;/strong&gt;. On Day 3, we had a large dataset that basically hosed the server because 21 students were trying to open it up at once. We managed to recover by getting another AWS server and dividing the students among the two, but we could have stress tested that day a little more. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going slowly enough&lt;/strong&gt;. I am a very excitable teacher, to the point of which sometimes I go a little too fast. I have to confess that I may have sped through some of the material a little too fast. As a result, some of the students didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what functions like &lt;code&gt;enumerate()&lt;/code&gt; were for and the concept of &lt;em&gt;unpacking&lt;/em&gt; a list. Luckily, Brad Buran covered these on Day 4 and the students felt comfortable enough to finish the programming test on the final day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting student expectations&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s vital to show the students that they can learn programming, but also what&amp;rsquo;s possible if they do. One of the days was a big leap from the previous day, but we did mention that it&amp;rsquo;s really to show them what&amp;rsquo;s possible if they continued to learn about programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;would-we-do-it-again&#34;&gt;Would we do it again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely say yes! We had to waitlist some students who really wanted to take it, and our overall feedback about the course was really positive. I hope that we can have more TAs, and have the future data workshops be more student driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowlegements&#34;&gt;Acknowlegements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a collaboration between the Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP) and the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NGP students involved in designing and testing the material were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniela Sadieri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucille Moore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Heller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zack Schwartz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty/Instructors involved were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Buran  (Research Instructor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen David (NGP Assistant Professor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa Karstens (DMICE Assistant Professor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Mooney (DMICE Assistant Professor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ted Laderas (DMICE Assistant Professor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much to Gary Westbrook (Director of the NGP program), Shannon McWeeney (Head of the Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology within DMICE), and Bill Hersh (Head of DMICE).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If you want to talk with me for an informational interview</title>
      <link>/2018/01/15/if-you-want-to-talk-with-me-for-an-informational-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/01/15/if-you-want-to-talk-with-me-for-an-informational-interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had many people who have asked me for informational interviews. They tell me that they are interested in Data Science and want to hear about what I do on a day to day basis. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to dread these kinds of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, I spend a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of energy explaining what I do to someone who rarely follows up. Consequently, I don&amp;rsquo;t find these interviews rewarding at all. So I&amp;rsquo;ve written this post so that I have a better time doing these kinds of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reserve the right to refuse interviews from people who do not read this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;Do your homework&lt;/em&gt;. Please don&amp;rsquo;t expect me to give the five minute spiel about my research, hoping to look for an &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo;. Please do some research and try to ask &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; questions about my work. I&amp;rsquo;ve given you plenty of resources on this website to know more about me. Ask me about my software, ask me about teaching, ask me carefully thought questions about my research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t offer to buy me coffee&lt;/em&gt;. If I talk with you for 30 minutes, know that my time is worth far more than a cup of coffee. Instead, offer to pay it forwards. Volunteer with a group that does scientific communication or education; I don&amp;rsquo;t work with people who aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to teach others. I don&amp;rsquo;t work or talk with selfish people, having been burned many times by such people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;em&gt;Be specific in your ask&lt;/em&gt;. Asking about what next steps to take in learning data science and where to get a job is not specific enough. Again, do your research. What kinds of Data Science are you interested in? Are you interested in predictive analytics in healthcare? Or are you interested in systems modeling of disease? Be specific, and if you ask for something, make sure I can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/the-five-minute-favour/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;achieve it in five minutes or less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t ask for a job, ask for connections&lt;/em&gt;. I know a decent number of people around Oregon and OHSU, so if you want me to introduce you to one of my connections, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to. If I know someone, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to do this, since it&amp;rsquo;s usually a five-minute ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;em&gt;Follow up, and be willing to return the favor&lt;/em&gt;. Even a nice thank-you email is good. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to make you a Linkedin connection, if it means I can help someone else further down the line. If I expend energy on you, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see my impact. If my efforts meant that you managed to find a job, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;em&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adamgrant.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Give and Take&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This book by Adam Grant really struck me as the way to actually network. In short, I learned that if I want a return on my energy expenditure, I have to spend my energy on Givers, or people who help others. I am a Giver, but I now tend only to give informational interviewers to other Givers. The rest are too draining for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have given so many of these interviews and have gotten nothing from them. Not even a follow-up, which really is bad practice. So, if I&amp;rsquo;m considered difficult to approach about these, know it is because your previous askers have really been an energy drain and have been inconsiderate Takers. Make it interesting for me and be considerate. I&amp;rsquo;m much more likely to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of python resources at OHSU and beyond for the neuroscience students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-neuroscience&#34;&gt;In Neuroscience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;python-bootcamp-for-neuroscientists-neus640&#34;&gt;Python Bootcamp for Neuroscientists (NEUS640)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Course Material&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is a gentle introduction to the Python
programming language using data types familiar to Neuroscience students, including behavioral, electrophysiology, and imaging data. Emphasis will be put on introducing students to concepts of visualization, data manipulation, and analysis using available Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology-dmice&#34;&gt;In Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-programming-no-course-number&#34;&gt;Introduction to Programming (no course number)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor: Lisa Karstens, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.0 credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/IntroductionToProgramming-Syllabus-WI18.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Course Syllabus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offered: Winter and Summer Quarter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This non-credit, online course will introduce the beginning programmer to programming structure and design, creating a solid foundation for all types of programming. The emphasis will be on procedural programming and control structures, although exercises will be in Python. The course fulfills the prerequisite for BMI 540 and BMI 565. Tuition fee is $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students may register during the regular winter and summer term registration periods. Contact Diane Doctor for details at doctord@ohsu.edu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bioinformatics-programming-and-scripting-bmi-565-656&#34;&gt;Bioinformatics Programming and Scripting - BMI 565 / 656&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor: Michael Mooney, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits: 3.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/BMI-565-Syllabus-FA17.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offered: Fall Quarter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this course is to equip research scientists with computational skills necessary to create and automate tools to analyze biological data.  The course is divided into four sub-topics: python programming, scripting in unix, biopython library, bioinformatics workflows.  Python will be used used to solve simple to sophisticated programming problems and to review general computational language paradigms such as problem abstraction, data types, file I/O, iteration, functions, and objects.  There will also be an emphasis on writing unix operating system shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks and connect disparate bioinformatics tools using files and pipes.  In addition, students will learn to access public repositories to perform basic bioinformatics tasks such as annotating gene products, sequence searching, and functional queries. This course is designed to be a first year requirement for students in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology graduate program in Biomedical Informatics. Open to other students with consent of instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisite&lt;/strong&gt;: Background must include an introductory programming class including concepts such as variables, loops, I/O, methods, and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;computer-science-and-electrical-engineering-cs-ee-python-courses&#34;&gt;Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (CS/EE) Python Courses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-science-programming-cs-527-627&#34;&gt;Data Science Programming - CS 527 / 627&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cslu.ohsu.edu/~kain/CS627/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Course Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is designed to give you awareness and initial working knowledge of some of the most fundamental computational tools for performing a wide variety of academic research. As such, it will focus on providing breadth instead of depth, which means that for each concept we will talk about motivation, key concepts, and concrete usage scenarios, but without mathematical background or proofs, which can be acquired in more specialized classes. In this class we will: become familiar with the UNIX/LINUX environment, learn how to version control files with git, write programs inpython, perform numeric tasks using numpy and scipy, analyze data using pandas, apply machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, visualize data using matplotlib and pyqtgraph, use QT/pyside to build graphical user interfaces, and finally we will address performance issues via compilation/profiling/parallelization tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-image-processing-ee-584-684&#34;&gt;Introduction to Image Processing EE 584 / 684&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course covers basic image processing principles and techniques with a brief introduction to machine vision. Specific topics include image transform methods, image filtering, image enhancement, image restoration, segmentation, image representation and feature extraction, image recognition and classification, and image compression. Application of these techniques is illustrated in numerous examples. Pre-requisite: probability and statistics or equivalent, calculus, linear algebra and proficiency in at least one high-level programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization-cs-631&#34;&gt;Data Visualization CS 631&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course will give students a foundation in the principles of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data, as well as provide students with hands-on experience using modern software tools for developing visualizations. Lecture topics will include an overview of visual perception, color theory and practice, different types of graphs and their purposes, visualizations for specialized forms of data including time-series and geospatial data sets, strategies for working with multidimensional data, etc. There will also be lecture content on ethical issues surrounding data visualization. Weekly lab sessions will introduce students to popular data visualization tools such as R&amp;rsquo;s ggplot and Shiny, Tableau, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;datacamp&#34;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEUS640 Students will have access to DataCamp for the next 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So You&#39;ve Accidentally Checked in a Large File Into Git</title>
      <link>/2018/01/05/so-you-ve-accidentally-checked-in-a-large-file-into-git/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/01/05/so-you-ve-accidentally-checked-in-a-large-file-into-git/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: after posting this, I heard back from Roberto Tyley, the creator of the BFG. I&amp;rsquo;d like to note that the BFG actually does its job really well. I was mostly really frustrated about how Git/GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent a user from doing something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. So my frustration is really about that, not really about the BFG. This post has been edited to reflect that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Wilson first said it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to agree. Git is an aggressively antisocial piece of software. Git is a piece of software that can make developers with any amount of experience feel dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I accidentally checked a large file (greater than 100 Megs) into my local repo. When I tried to push to GitHub, of course, it refused it (I know about git large file storage, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my local repo was screwed up. Of course, I did what seemed like the rational thing and deleted the file from my repo and recommitted. More than once. This is a mistake I&amp;rsquo;ve done more than once. So you need to scrub your git history with BFG so that GitHub will accept your lowly commits again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The BFG&lt;/a&gt; documentation specifies how to fix a &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; repo. I would say that this situation is much less common than the local situation. So I just decided to share how I got the BFG to work for the local repo situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually install the BFG through &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt;, using &lt;code&gt;brew install bfg&lt;/code&gt;. When you install it this way, you can just run BFG with &lt;code&gt;bfg&lt;/code&gt;. You can download it from the website, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to call &lt;code&gt;java -jar bfg[VERSION].jar&lt;/code&gt; to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;rsquo;ve accidently checked in a large file into your current repo. The first thing to do is to clone your local repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone --mirror local_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create another folder called &lt;code&gt;local_repo.git&lt;/code&gt; that you will do all the BFG magic on. This &lt;code&gt;local_rep.git&lt;/code&gt; is what is called a &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; repo. I want to remove any files larger than 100 Megs, so I do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bfg -b 100M local_repo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t return an error, you can move on. However, I got the dreaded error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning : no large blobs matching criteria found in packfiles - 
does the repo need to be packed?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augh. Ok, some googling later I found that I needed to pack my orignal repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd local_repo
git repack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, we need to get rid of our cloned repo and redo the last few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm -rf local_repo.git
git clone --mirror local_repo
bfg -b 100M local_repo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes some git commands that no one has bothered to explain to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reflog expire --expire=now --all &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh oh, I get a &lt;code&gt;remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master&lt;/code&gt; error! More ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the trick. Since you cloned a &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; repo, you need to set the origin of your current repo (&lt;code&gt;local_repo.git&lt;/code&gt;) to the GitHub remote. First we remove the current &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;, and then add back our remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after much gnashing of the teeth, we can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to remove your now &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;local_repo&lt;/code&gt;, and the mirrored copy, and then pull a fresh copy down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##remove both original local repo and altered bare repo
rm -rf local_repo
rm -rf local_repo.git
##clone a fresh copy from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be obvious to the 10 people in the world who have read all of the git documentation, but I am not one of them. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with git, unfortunately. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to remind me of what to do when I innocently do something like commit a large file to my repo.&lt;/p&gt;
