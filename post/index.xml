      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, the week of teaching our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Python Bootcamp for Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; is over. I had the pleasure of working with a great group of students, professors and instructors in developing the material, and had a great time teaching complete beginners to programming and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the overall goal of introducting 21 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/neuroscience-graduate-program/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Neuroscience Graduate Program&lt;/a&gt; students at OHSU to the basics of programming in Python using data that they were interested in: electrophysiology data, and confocal microscopy data. The course was designed to be a 1 credit course to encourage students to persist and finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format of the class was spread over 5 days (2.5 hours a day) and had the following schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to basic data types in Python&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to for loops and Pandas DataFrames&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Pandas to analyse electrophysiology data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using NumPy to analyse confocal microscopy data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of students; installing Python/Juypter; wrap-up with questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just write up some random thoughts about our experiences about the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-that-really-worked-well&#34;&gt;Things that really worked well&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid the first day blues of installing Python by using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JupyterHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I think one of the major pain points for beginners is installing software before they can even learn. Instead of making them install Python the first day, we had them sign into an AWS server that had JuypterHub deployed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JupyterHub is a multi-user server for Juypter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; which had the right version of Python and our need the dependencies installed. So our students just needed a laptop and a web browser to access our lessons. We could update the notebooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen David, my fellow instructor, figured this out. He has put together some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/blob/master/server_setup/hubInstall.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handy instructions about deploying JuypterHub to AWS&lt;/a&gt; and keeping the accounts updated via a GitHub repo in case other people are interested in using our bootcamp materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make the atmosphere welcoming to beginners&lt;/em&gt;. In order to do so, we used many great tips from Software/Data Carpentry: modeling resilience by using live coding (and making mistakes along the way), using post-it notes for students to signal when they need help or are finished, and having plenty of TAs per student (at least 4 students/TA or instructor). We tried to emphasize that learning programming is an ongoing process, and that even we still have to Google errors on Stack Overflow. Showing that you can make mistakes and still recover is a big part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plan some early wins and make the exercises as interactive as possible.&lt;/em&gt; For the most part, we tried to avoid lecturing too long and break up the session with interactive exercises. I also really don&amp;rsquo;t like workshops where the trainer/teacher moves on no matter whether people understand the material or not. By using the post-its to signal when they were done, we were able to more appropriately pace the workshop. We also planned on stopping points if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get through the day&amp;rsquo;s materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emphasize working together and building a community.&lt;/em&gt; From the beginning, we emphasized that everyone needed to work together. I always emphasize the chain of help: 1) First your programming partner, 2) then the TA help. Discussing and working on issues together fosters a sense of community. I think there will be a group of students who will really want to learn more because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting feedback along the way&lt;/em&gt;. I still feel like being a teacher is about 75% preparation and 25% improvisation. You need to be flexible enough to come up with examples on the fly, and you need to evaluate whether students are getting the material along the way. The exercises we tried to sprinkle throughout the notebooks helped us understand where people were stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning follow-up sessions&lt;/em&gt;. Through BioData Club, we&amp;rsquo;re planning some follow-up sessions. Through DataCamp in the Classroom, I also got our students premium access. We also pointed students out to &lt;a href=&#34;/python_resources/&#34;&gt;other Python-based courses at OHSU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-things-we-could-improve-on&#34;&gt;Some things we could improve on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that given our time frame, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really have anticipated many of these issues. We did our best to deal with them in the moment, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Describing the difference between Jupyter Notebooks and Python&lt;/em&gt;. At the beginning, we glossed over what a Jupyter Notebook was and really didn&amp;rsquo;t describe its relation to Python. I think next time we will open with describing the relationship between Jupyter and Python with a diagram, and revisit it on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anticipate the JupyterHub server requirements better&lt;/em&gt;. On Day 3, we had a large dataset that basically hosed the server because 21 students were trying to open it up at once. We managed to recover by getting another AWS server and dividing the students among the two, but we could have stress tested that day a little more. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going slowly enough&lt;/em&gt;. I am a very excitable teacher, to the point of which sometimes I go a little too fast. I have to confess that I may have sped through some of the material a little too fast. As a result, some of the students didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get what functions like &lt;code&gt;enumerate()&lt;/code&gt; were for and the concept of &lt;em&gt;unpacking&lt;/em&gt; a list. Luckily, Brad covered these on Day 4 and the students felt comfortable enough to finish the programming test on the final day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting student expectations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;would-we-do-it-again&#34;&gt;Would we do it again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely say yes! We had to waitlist some students who really wanted to take it, and our overall feedback about the course was really positive. I hope that we can have more TAs, and have the future data workshops be more student driven.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So You&#39;ve Accidentally Checked in a Large File Into Git</title>
      <link>/2018/01/05/so-you-ve-accidentally-checked-in-a-large-file-into-git/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/01/05/so-you-ve-accidentally-checked-in-a-large-file-into-git/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: after posting this, I heard back from Roberto Tyley, the creator of the BFG. I&amp;rsquo;d like to note that the BFG actually does its job really well. I was mostly really frustrated about how Git/GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent a user from doing something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. So my frustration is really about that, not really about the BFG. This post has been edited to reflect that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Wilson first said it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to agree. Git is an aggressively antisocial piece of software. Git is a piece of software that can make developers with any amount of experience feel dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I accidentally checked a large file (greater than 100 Megs) into my local repo. When I tried to push to GitHub, of course, it refused it (I know about git large file storage, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my local repo was screwed up. Of course, I did what seemed like the rational thing and deleted the file from my repo and recommitted. More than once. This is a mistake I&amp;rsquo;ve done more than once. So you need to scrub your git history with BFG so that GitHub will accept your lowly commits again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The BFG&lt;/a&gt; documentation specifies how to fix a &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; repo. I would say that this situation is much less common than the local situation. So I just decided to share how I got the BFG to work for the local repo situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually install the BFG through &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt;, using &lt;code&gt;brew install bfg&lt;/code&gt;. When you install it this way, you can just run BFG with &lt;code&gt;bfg&lt;/code&gt;. You can download it from the website, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to call &lt;code&gt;java -jar bfg[VERSION].jar&lt;/code&gt; to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;rsquo;ve accidently checked in a large file into your current repo. The first thing to do is to clone your local repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone --mirror local_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create another folder called &lt;code&gt;local_repo.git&lt;/code&gt; that you will do all the BFG magic on. This &lt;code&gt;local_rep.git&lt;/code&gt; is what is called a &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; repo. I want to remove any files larger than 100 Megs, so I do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bfg -b 100M local_repo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t return an error, you can move on. However, I got the dreaded error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning : no large blobs matching criteria found in packfiles - 
does the repo need to be packed?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augh. Ok, some googling later I found that I needed to pack my orignal repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd local_repo
git repack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, we need to get rid of our cloned repo and redo the last few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm -rf local_repo.git
git clone --mirror local_repo
bfg -b 100M local_repo.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes some git commands that no one has bothered to explain to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reflog expire --expire=now --all &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh oh, I get a &lt;code&gt;remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master&lt;/code&gt; error! More ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the trick. Since you cloned a &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; repo, you need to set the origin of your current repo (&lt;code&gt;local_repo.git&lt;/code&gt;) to the GitHub remote. First we remove the current &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;, and then add back our remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after much gnashing of the teeth, we can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to remove your now &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;local_repo&lt;/code&gt;, and the mirrored copy, and then pull a fresh copy down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##remove both original local repo and altered bare repo
rm -rf local_repo
rm -rf local_repo.git
##clone a fresh copy from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/laderast/remote_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be obvious to the 10 people in the world who have read all of the git documentation, but I am not one of them. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with git, unfortunately. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to remind me of what to do when I innocently do something like commit a large file to my repo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Tidy Evaluation in R</title>
      <link>/2017/12/19/understanding-tidyeval/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/12/19/understanding-tidyeval/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had something that no matter how many times someone explained it, you really had no idea what it was for? For me, that was Non Standard Evaluation (NSE) in R, and its newer cousin Tidy Evaluation, or &lt;code&gt;tidyeval&lt;/code&gt;. I had a real learning block about it. I really wanted to understand it, but for some reason I just really wasn’t getting the general concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is evaluation, really? For the longest time, I was extremely confused about it. When you provide an expression to R such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)
this_variable &amp;lt;- 2
this_variable * 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice that there is an output to &lt;code&gt;this_variable * 6&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt;. Evaluation is really about looking up variable names in an environment and then acting on the results. What is going on here is that R looks for an object that is named &lt;code&gt;this_variable&lt;/code&gt; in our global environment, and then returns the value, &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, which it then &lt;em&gt;substitutes&lt;/em&gt; in the expression. So our original expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;this_variable * 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becomes this expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 * 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which R knows how to calculate, the output of which is &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt;. But sometimes you want to pass an expression or a variable, as is, without evaluating it first. The best case for this is to passing a variable into a function. We can do this by wrapping them up in &lt;code&gt;quosures&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;enquosures&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;enquosure&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as envelopes around an object. They obscure certain properties of the object until they can be delivered into a function. The envelopes basically are a way to sneak variables and expressions into a function’s environment. When the envelope is in the function, we can open it up and evaluate what’s in the envelope. The trick to NSE and tidyeval is that we can control when the function &lt;em&gt;evaluates&lt;/em&gt; the expression, by controlling when we open this envelope. We do this by using the &lt;code&gt;UQ()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;code&gt;quosures&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enquosures&lt;/code&gt; are ways to prevent R from looking up a variable’s value in our current environment (usually the global environment), and delay this lookup until we get them into the environment of interest. This might be one level down (in our function of interest), or several levels down (in a function called by our function).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, R won’t open the envelope with our variable in it until we tell it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-should-i-care&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Should I Care????&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer: if you want to write functions that directly work with the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;, you need to understand &lt;code&gt;tidyeval&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to understand why you need to do this is to write a function that takes a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; and a reference to a column within that &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;. You might notice that we can directly refer to a column in a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt;, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mtcars %&amp;gt;% select(cyl) %&amp;gt;% head(10)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                   cyl
## Mazda RX4           6
## Mazda RX4 Wag       6
## Datsun 710          4
## Hornet 4 Drive      6
## Hornet Sportabout   8
## Valiant             6
## Duster 360          8
## Merc 240D           4
## Merc 230            4
## Merc 280            6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does that work? This is the power of NSE and tidy evaluation. Basically, by wrapping up &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; in an envelope, we prevent R from &lt;em&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt; it right away. We can then pass the envelope into other functions, or environments, and then tell R to remove the envelope and then &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try and mimic this. We’ll write a function &lt;code&gt;grab_col(x, colname)&lt;/code&gt; which returns the values in the column whose name we ask for as an object. If we do this, without tidyeval, this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grab_col &amp;lt;- function(x, colname){
  x %&amp;gt;%
    pull(colname)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try running &lt;code&gt;grab_col(mtcars, colname=cyl)&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll get an error that &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; does not exist as an object. Augh! This is harder than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we fix this? We can wrap &lt;code&gt;colname&lt;/code&gt; up in an &lt;code&gt;enquosure&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;enquo()&lt;/code&gt; function. Once it’s into &lt;code&gt;pull()&lt;/code&gt;, we use &lt;code&gt;UQ()&lt;/code&gt; to open the envelope and R knows that it should look in the &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;’s environment for our &lt;code&gt;colname&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(rlang)

grab_col &amp;lt;- function(x, colname){
  ##wrap up colname in an enquosure
  cc &amp;lt;- rlang::enquo(colname)

  ##use UQ to evaluate it within the pull function
  x %&amp;gt;%
    pull(
      ## unquote and evaluate (open the envelope!)
      UQ(cc)
      )
}

grab_col(mtcars, colname=cyl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1] 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 8 6 8 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now try &lt;code&gt;grab_col(mtcars, colname=cyl)&lt;/code&gt;. Nifty, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;with-quosures-values-can-come-along-for-the-ride&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt;s, values can come along for the ride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would we use &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt;s at all, instead of &lt;code&gt;enquosure&lt;/code&gt;s? Because with &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt;s we can actually bring some needed values along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-about-lots-of-arguments&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about lots of arguments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what &lt;code&gt;quos()&lt;/code&gt; is for. Ever notice that you can specify a number of unnamed arguments by specifying a &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; in your function definition? And did you ever notice that &lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt; can take lots of arguments such as &lt;code&gt;select(mpg, cyl, wt)&lt;/code&gt;? That is the power of &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; combined with &lt;code&gt;quos()&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;quos&lt;/code&gt; takes a list and makes each element of the list a &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-about-expressions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about expressions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we wanted to pass an expression such as &lt;code&gt;cyl &amp;gt; 2&lt;/code&gt; into our function. We’ll need to wrap it up in &lt;code&gt;enexpr()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;enquo()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;filter_on_column &amp;lt;- function(x, col_expr){
  c_e &amp;lt;- rlang::enexpr(col_expr)

  x %&amp;gt;%
    ## The !! (called a bangbang) is just another way to use UQ()
    ## I don&amp;#39;t really like it, I&amp;#39;d rather use UQ()
    filter(!! c_e)
}

#pass in a simple expression
mtcars %&amp;gt;% filter_on_column(cyl &amp;gt; 2) %&amp;gt;% head(5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb

&lt;div id=&#34;be-really-careful-with&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be really careful with &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we used &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;, called a bangbang, to unquote and evaluate our expression. Be really careful with what you put after the &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;, since everything after it will be evaluated. If you have elements after the expression you don’t want to unquote, wrap the &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; up in a set of parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bang &amp;lt;- function(val2){
  x &amp;lt;- enquo(val2)
  return((!! x) + 10)
}

bang(5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;other-applications&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest applications of NSE is to write code that writes code. You have to be very careful with this, but it’s potentially really useful. On my list of things to do for my &lt;code&gt;flowDashboard&lt;/code&gt; package is to write code that generates a standalone app given the data objects you supply it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;appendix-what-is-a-quosure-really&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix: What is a &lt;code&gt;quosure&lt;/code&gt;, really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;for-more-information&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For more information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this was helpful in understanding NSE and tidyeval. I find that sometimes I have to write things up so I more clearly understand it. So, if anything, writing this was useful for clarifying my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m indebted to Edwin Thoen’s code examples that helped me finally understand what’s going on with &lt;code&gt;tidyeval&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://edwinth.github.io/blog/dplyr-recipes/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://edwinth.github.io/blog/dplyr-recipes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really talk about Base-R’s NSE, but I would say that this should at least give you enough background to understand what’s going on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Using Synthetic Data for Teaching Data Science</title>
      <link>/2017/12/14/using-synthetic-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/12/14/using-synthetic-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone, our paper called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/12/232611&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaching data science fundamentals through realistic synthetic clinical cardiovascular data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now available to read on Biorxiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we talk about a dataset that we synthesized for teaching aspects of clinical data that may be tricky to understand in data science. This dataset is interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve used this dataset for a couple of classes, and we&amp;rsquo;ve found that it helps highlight real issues in predictive modeling of clinical data. One of the largest is that most predictive models are based on a much older patient cohort (50+), which means that we don&amp;rsquo;t know much about how to predict cardiovascular risk in younger patients. Part of the teaching exercise is having the students choose a cohort of interest and then attempt to predict on that patient cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is currently available as an R package here, including vignettes about how the data was generated: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laderast/cvdRiskData&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/laderast/cvdRiskData&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes on Open Data Science Conference West 2017</title>
      <link>/2017/11/07/odsc-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/11/07/odsc-notes/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I just came back from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://odscwest.pathable.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Data Science Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ODSC) in San Francisco and I found it really stimulating and interesting. I learned a ton, met some great people working in very different fields, and overall found it quite worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the highlights from my notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;workshops&#34;&gt;Workshops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amueller/ml-training-intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scikit-learn intro Workshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amueller/ml-training-advanced&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advanced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit that I am not really a Python person. But I am helping to develop some materials for an introductory workshop and I found this workshop and its materials to be a very beginner-friendly to &lt;code&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/code&gt; and machine learning concepts, much like &lt;code&gt;caret&lt;/code&gt; for R. All the slides and workshop materials are available at the above links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WinVector/ODSCWest2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SparklyR Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this workshop from John Mount of Win-Vector. It started out with a &lt;em&gt;dplyr&lt;/em&gt; intro, and introduced us to the basics of Apache Spark, which is a cluster-computing based machine learning framework, which is designed to do very large queries and machine learning. RStudio&amp;rsquo;s Edgar Ruiz managed to get us each an RStudio Pro Instance running on AWS with all the required packages installed so we could test out the SparklyR package, which uses dplyr&amp;rsquo;s commands to run Spark jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3MFD2S4MhtGd1ltVHZkbFhHX0ZUbGlGZmtNRjllQ2NtQkJN/view?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;In-Memory Computing Essentials for Data Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an introduction to Apache Ignite, which is a distributed, in-memory database that can be leveraged by different languages. The really interesting thing about Ignite is that it will colocate related data on the same cluster node, resulting in rapid queries within each node. I think this technology will become very important as we need more datasets to be openly accessible to compute on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talks&#34;&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the most interesting talks that I attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mfviz.com/odsc-2017/#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Visually Explaining Statistical and Machine Learning Concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a great talk by Mike Freedman about his process of how he put together D3.js based visualizations to explain some statistical concepts. I thought the explanation of his process (isolate specific ideas, identify data structures, leverage visualization algorithms). Check out the slides above. They&amp;rsquo;re very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://odscwest.pathable.com/meetings/596522&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Wonder Twins: Data Science and Human Centered Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really interesting talk about the interplay between data science and design in helping encourage a mobile money system in Tanzania. It was inspiring to see how they had both designers and data scientists embedded and looking at how the mobile payment system worked. One interesting example was doing network analysis of the Mobile Money Agents, who distribute cash. They targeted a highly influential group of these agents based on this analysis. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://odscwest.pathable.com/meetings/601861&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Data&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://odscwest.pathable.com/meetings/604496&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Deontology of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought these were really interesting sides about the human side of data science. DJ Patil, who was chief data scientist under the Obama administration, talked about citizen-driven data projects and how it enabled a number of advances. The most interesting case was basically a parent built an online community of people who had a very rare disease condition so he could help his son with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Igor Perisic (of LinkedIn) followed this with a talk about ethical issues in data science. In particular, he identified three different areas to concentrate on: 1) The Ethics of Data, 2) The Ethics of Algorithms, and 3) The Ethics of practice. He concentrated on the recent New York Times article about using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/sent-to-prison-by-a-software-programs-secret-algorithms.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;machine learning to identify potential re-offenders in the prison system&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of transparency in how the algorithm identifies potential reoffenders is a huge ethical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, I had an interesting time and I met lots of people in industry, which was a nice contrast to the academic side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest concepts as an analyst that I have struggled with is separating my code from my data. A related issue is making your code reproducible across data instances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data</title>
      <link>/2017/06/28/howtonotbeafraid/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a talk for the PDX RLang Meetup on July 11 called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/events/240846589/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data: Teaching EDA using Shiny&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Abstract below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many graduate students in the basic sciences are afraid of data exploration and cleaning, which can greatly impact their downstream analysis results. By using a synthetic dataset, some simple &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; commands, and a &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt; dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units). For this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll run through a simple EDA example (combining two weight loss datasets) with a general data explorer in &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt; that can be easily customized to teach specific EDA concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Lessons We Learned Running Cascadia-R</title>
      <link>/2017/06/07/cascadiarnotes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/06/07/cascadiarnotes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://cascadiarconf.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cascadia R Conference&lt;/a&gt; has come and gone. I have to say that it was super fun, and well attended (over 190 people!). I had a blast meeting and chatting with everyone. Hopefully, we showed newbies that R is learnable and others that there are lots more things to learn about R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is my attempt to document what we learned from organizing Cascadia-R. It&amp;rsquo;s not complete; I may add and subtract from it as I think of more things to say about the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide the tone&lt;/strong&gt;. Our goals with Cascadia-R were modest. We wanted to get a diverse group of R users together in a safe and encouraging environment. We wanted our workshops to be accessible to even beginners, and encourage them in the use of R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of meeting these goals of this is setting the tone. We really wanted to encourage all levels of R users to attend. All of our flyers, emails and promotional tweets encouraged beginners to come. We got help with making a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cascadiarconf.com/coc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; for the conference. Part of creating a supportive environment is encouraging diversity in both speakers and attendees. We did our best to reach out to current groups that encourage diversity, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://wisportland.weebly.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Women in Science Portland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R-Ladies Global&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also offered diversity scholarships to encourage people from diverse backgrounds to attend, and made diversity part of our criteria for selecting talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start planning early&lt;/strong&gt;. As junior faculty at OHSU, I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to book facilities here, including the large learning studios where we held the conference. Having the venue secured early on made the remaining logistics of the conference much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like wedding planning, there are plenty of conference planning services out there who would be happy to take over aspects of your conference, for a fee. You can spend however much you want to on these things. However, I believe that such a approach is not financially responsible. I also feel that taking a more DIY/bespoke approach can make a conference most engaging (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://csvconf.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;csvconf&lt;/a&gt;). We tried to do most things ourselves (including design, promotion, talk submission, workshops, and registration/logistics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterate your budget&lt;/strong&gt;. Think of a conference as a project with lots of linked dependencies. Your first plan is probably not going to be your final plan. Start a plan, iterate, realize that things are going to shift, have a backup plan. What if registration is not going to pay for the venue rental fee? Talking to simpatico sponsors can take much of the financial stress. In our case, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rstudio&lt;/a&gt; foundation and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ROpenSci&lt;/a&gt; stepped up to contribute some money as a cushion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, there are &lt;em&gt;fixed costs&lt;/em&gt; (such as venue rental, and recording/streaming costs) and &lt;em&gt;variable costs&lt;/em&gt; that scale with the number of attendees (food, badges, alcohol). Separate these out. When possible, pay off the fixed costs first, so that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to manage the variable costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, who is your desired audience and can they afford your conference? We decided to make our conference as affordable as possible to encourage as many different kinds of people to attend. We initially wanted to make attendance free for students. The problem with free is that literally it&amp;rsquo;s free. It has no value in the mind of a person who accepts free admission. So we decided to charge students a small fee just to emphasize that the conference has value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk with others who have done it&lt;/strong&gt;. We were very clueless about much of the logistics side at OHSU. I managed to get through by talking with a number of people here (including Robin Champieux and Shannon McWeeney) who have done conferences here at OHSU. Thank you so much for your invaluable advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage each other and delegate&lt;/strong&gt;. No one of us could have done all of the conference planning alone. Each of us took on various aspects of conference organization and brought in the others as support as needed. Some of us selected talks, some of us did design, and we all pitched in to get registration working as efficiently and quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our slack channel on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pdxdata.slack.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pdxdata.slack.com&lt;/a&gt; is full of our decisions. Slack was so useful as a planning mechanism that we only met online via Google Hangouts a few times, and only had two in-person planning sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Willing to Make Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;. Lord knows I made a bunch of mistakes when I made announcements and hosted the lightning sessions. However, I owned up to these mistakes, shrugged, and moved on. Improvising in the moment can be just as important as planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about the future&lt;/strong&gt;. What should the next Cascadia-R look like? I know it just happened, but we&amp;rsquo;re trying to envision what it would look like. Based on the feedback we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten so far, people really want more workshops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a following post, I&amp;rsquo;m also going to talk about lessons I learned when Chester and I put on our tidyverse workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building an Open Source Community</title>

      <title>On Breadth and Depth in Your Academic Career</title>
      <link>/2017/04/19/breadth-and-depth/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a student and they were complaining that when at conferences, they would try to inject other topics of interest (such as cooking) into discussions with colleagues. Unfortunately, one of the after effects of this was that they were looked at as &amp;ldquo;not a serious scientist&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s an expectation that a scientist must be all depth, only talking and thinking about their sub-field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cross disciplinarian, I have to say that is hogwash. The genesis of so many creative ideas in science has happened because of cross-pollination across disciplines. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/lindau-nobel-meeting-the-cross-pollination-of-ideas/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;microwave technology&lt;/a&gt; might never have been invented without the intersection of disciplines. We know that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kendell_Pawelec/publication/247857346_Arts_Foster_Scientific_Success_Avocations_of_Nobel_National_Academy_Royal_Society_and_Sigma_Xi_Members/links/00b4953c00f875f191000000.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arts Foster Scientific Success&lt;/a&gt; - a large number of Nobel and National Academy members do art in some form or other. Bernstein et al theorize that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“there exist functional connections between scientific talent and arts,
crafts, and communications talents so that inheriting or developing one
fosters the other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having breadth and depth enables you to make connections that no one else has. It is the hallmark of a curious and creative person. These kinds of people are desparately needed to push science in new directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a parallel career in &lt;a href=&#34;http://15people.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;performance and improvisational music&lt;/a&gt;. Music, for me, is endlessly inspiring and has forced me out of my introverted shell. One of the reasons I took up cello is that I can play many roles; accompanist, rhythm, solo. This flexibility in playing music has translated to my flexibility in collaboration. Being able to adjust to new circumstances and improvise new ideas to explore is a critical component of being a responsible scientist. My background improvisation has helped me pivot ideas. I have become less attached to dogmatic ideas. Many of my good ideas come from idle wondering about data that has captured my imagination. This is part of the reason why I teach students &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laderast/shinyEDA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to explore their data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the next time another scientist looks down at you for being a polymath, pity them. Their world and their ideas are not as rich as yours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fostering a Peer Mentoring Culture</title>
      <link>/2017/04/17/building-a-peer-mentoring/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/04/17/building-a-peer-mentoring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realize that it has been an embarrasingly long time since I updated this blog. I had all sorts of grandiose plans for it, and I think my problem was that I was thinking too broad, too pie-in-the-sky. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to focus on short and informative blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I have been thinking about graduate school is the idea of building a Peer Mentoring culture in our department. I believe that students should help and support each other, and we need to provide a forum to do that. Not just assign mentors, but provide a time and a place to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try to foster a mentoring culture within our student group, &lt;a href=&#34;https://biodata-club.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BioData-Club&lt;/a&gt;. Students are free to talk about issues that concern them, especially about datasets, and are encouraged to share their experiences of software that they&amp;rsquo;ve used. I believe that we try to give students a psychologically safe place to talk about their issues with data. We try to make people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re not alone, and coach beginners so they can get over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re now embarking on an experiment to reach even more people at OHSU, because we know there are lots of students who struggle with practical skills in data analysis. Our group is growing, and that&amp;rsquo;s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and get everyone in our group to write a paper about Peer Mentoring Culture and how to encourage it in other schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install&#34;&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can choose from one of the following four methods to install:
* one-click install using your web browser (recommended)
* install on your computer using Git with the Command Prompt/Terminal app
* install on your computer by downloading the ZIP files
* install on your computer with RStudio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-install-using-your-web-browser&#34;&gt;Quick install using your web browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Install Academic with Netlify&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netlify will provide you with a customizable URL to access your new site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On GitHub, go to your newly created &lt;code&gt;academic-kickstart&lt;/code&gt; repository and edit &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; to personalize your site. Shortly after saving the file, your site will automatically update&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace &lt;code&gt;sourcethemes&lt;/code&gt; with your GitHub username.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initialize the theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd My_Website
git submodule update --init --recursive
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-with-zip&#34;&gt;Install with ZIP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/archive/master.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and extract &lt;em&gt;Academic Kickstart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/archive/master.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and extract the &lt;em&gt;Academic theme&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/&lt;/code&gt; folder from the above step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-with-rstudio&#34;&gt;Install with RStudio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-rstudio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;View the guide to installing Academic with RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;quick-start&#34;&gt;Quick start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you installed on your computer, view your new website by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/a&gt; and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Quick Start Guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to add Markdown content, customize your site, and deploy it. For inspiration, refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown content&lt;/a&gt; which powers the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build your site by running the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command. Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;host it for free using Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university&amp;rsquo;s hosting service).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating&#34;&gt;Updating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt; the project on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; to help keep track of updates and check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/tags/updates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; prior to updating your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your &lt;code&gt;themes/academic&lt;/code&gt; directory) and record your current version number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git submodule update --remote --merge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Surrogate Oncogene Paper is Published</title>
      <link>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dissertation paper, &lt;a href=&#34;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2015.00341/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Network-Based Model of Oncogenic Collaboration for Prediction of Drug Sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; is now published! Here&amp;rsquo;s a lay summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One outstanding issue in analyzing genomics in the context of personalized medicine is the incorporation of rare
or infrequent genetic alterations (copy number alterations and somatic mutations) that are observed in individual &amp;gt; patients. We hypothesize that these mutations may actually &amp;lsquo;collaborate&amp;rsquo; with known oncogenes in the genesis of
tumors through their interactions. In order to show this effect, we assess whether these interacting rare
mutations cluster around known oncogenes and assess these mutational clusters, which we term &lt;em&gt;surrogate
oncogenes&lt;/em&gt;. We assess their statistical significance using a simple model of mutation. We show that surrogate
oncogenes are predictive of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, they are prevalent in
three different cancer cohorts (Breast, Glioblastoma, and Bladder Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Within
the Breast Cancer and Bladder Cancer populations, surrogate oncogenes are predictive of overall patient
survival. The chief strength of the surrogate oncogene approach is that it can be run at a single-patient
level in comparison to other methods of assessing mutational significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more, you can check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/surrogateShiny/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Surrogate Oncogene Explorer&lt;/a&gt; in order to understand the nature of surrogate oncogenes, and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laderast/surrogateMutation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R/Bioconductor Package on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to try out the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a follow-up paper that I&amp;rsquo;m working on that I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about. More news soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Short-Order Bioinformatics Doesn&#39;t Work</title>
      <link>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many researchers look at computational biology and bioinformatics as a black-box: you put in data, and you get results out. The bioinformaticians and computational biologists are seen as mostly computer operators who push the button and not as true collaborators. One of my co-workers calls this &amp;ldquo;short-order&amp;rdquo; bioinformatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is great danger in simply pushing a button to get results. One type of analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is highly dependent on how mutations are incorporated into a gene set. If done carelessly, the results can be spurious. One paper dependent on GSEA analysis was Dixson, et al. This paper, &lt;em&gt;Identification of gene ontologies linked to prefrontal–hippocampal functional coupling in the human brain&lt;/em&gt; was retracted. A single SNP was assigned to 8 genes and was thus over counted. Their GSEA result of &amp;ldquo;synapse organization and biogenesis&amp;rdquo; was spurious due to this assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of impatience from collaborators when results are not immediate. Understandably, much of this work is done to support a grant and there are always looming deadlines. However, there is a lot of work between a request and well-executed computational results. Potential collaborators need to be aware of these steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-executed workflow is thus essential for the computational results to be valid. This may include the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping of identifiers for entities for each platform to the appropriate gene construct.&lt;/em&gt; In the case of the SNP paper, it was appropriate assignment of SNPs to genes. However, with Systems Biology that integrate multiple OMICs types, this can include mapping protein isoforms to the mRNA transcripts if one is interested in the impact of alternative splicing. A clear strategy must be decided on and then executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Management&lt;/em&gt; Oftentimes, we need to work with the experimentalists who are executing the research in order to understand and identify potential confounders in the data. We do this by collected and integrating metadata into our analysis, that is, data about how the experiments were executed. We need to identify technical issues such as batch effects, and scheduling time with the experimentalists is our best way of identifying these potential issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flagging of potentially spurious samples.&lt;/em&gt; This part of the process requires exploratory data analysis on gross measurements used in the high-throughput platforms. For example, we may visualize boxplots of mean expression for each sample to see if the expression levels can be compared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection of the appropriate statistical protocol given the experimental design.&lt;/em&gt; This may require a couple of back and forths between the computational biologist and the researcher. A good computational biologist never assumes anything about the data or design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a well-mapped strategy of data cleaning, the results from any bioinformatics analysis may be suspect. A good bioinformatics collaborator will ask these questions and will not take no for an answer. Any information that you withhold from your collaborator will affect their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, treating computational biology as a black-box is done at the researcher&amp;rsquo;s peril. Instead, a collaboration should be fostered. The best level of collaboration with computational biologists is to include them from the beginning, as part of the experimental design. This is obviously a greater level of commitment and time than simply considering them as a service core. However, the benefits and rewards are much greater at this level of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
