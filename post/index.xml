      <title>Setting Boundaries and Saying No</title>

      <description>I hate saying no. But as I go on in life, I realize that I can&amp;rsquo;t be all things to all people. I want to help people, but I also have to have enough energy to get through the day.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to go through life doing what everyone expects of you and have nothing to show for it. In fact, this is often the curse of hyper-competent people. People tend to see you as a gear that fits within their own vision and expect you to do things for them.</description>

      <title>Getting LearnR tutorials to run on mybinder.org</title>

      <description>The learnr package is a wonderful way to package your tutorials. Anyone can download a learnr package of tutorials, and use learnr::run_tutorial() to run them on their own personal system.
Since learnr is based on shiny, these tutorials can also be published to a Shiny server such as shinyapps.io. However, one drawback to this is that the more popular the tutorial, the more access time you may be on the hook for, which can rapidly become expensive.</description>

      <title>Notes on the RStudio Instructor Training Experience</title>
      <link>/2019/11/15/my-experience-with-rstudio-instructor-training/</link>

      <description>Full Disclosure: my department paid for the training and two of the certification exams. I did the Shiny exam for free with the stipulation that I would provide feedback on the exam itself.
 I recently became a certified RStudio Instructor in both Shiny and the Tidyverse. I thought I would write a little about the experience. I haven’t really had any formal pedagogical training, and having some of the state of the art and evidence-based practices were really helpful in extending my approaches to teaching.</description>

      <description>In healthy cultures, people rise by elevating others and fall by undermining others. In toxic cultures, people are forced to choose between helping others and achieving success. Choose the workplace where success comes from making others successful. - Adam Grant
 When I read Adam Grant’s Give and Take, it was like a light went off. In this book, Grant gives profiles of highly successful people who are givers - people who have changed their field by making things better for others.</description>

      <description>Last year about this time, I had a meltdown, which is a symptom of burnout. I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain a little bit about my burnout in the hopes that other people can avoid it.
I want to help people, and I’m a people pleaser. I’m a giver, and sometimes I give too much, to the point I have nothing left. I have to be aware when people exploit this. One collaboration, unfortunately took advantage of my giving nature.</description>

      <description>As part of my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution to learn new things about R, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to plug some holes in my R knowledge by writing more vignettes to explain them to myself this year.
This week I finally think I understand more about namespaces in R and why you should use them in your R package.
Namespaces: Why Bother? In short, we need namespaces because of the ambiguity of function names.</description>

      <description>Well, RStudio Conf 2019 has come and gone. I attended the main conference, starting with the poster session on wednesday and stayed through the tidyverse developer day on Saturday.
To say that the conference was inspiring was an understatement. So many talented people working on such interesting and inspiring packages! It made me excited again about doing data science and teaching data science.
This post is going to highlight the interesting talks about education and organizational management at the conference.</description>

      <description>At some point in your life in Data Science, you will probably struggle with impostor syndrome. We all do - in fact, even though I have used R and have done bioinformatics and data science for more than 15 years, I still struggle with this feeling. As a beginner, the mountain you must climb to master skills in data science seems like a long and impossible one.
Caitlin Hudon, in her post about dealing with impostor syndrome has this to say about countering impostor syndrome:</description>

      <description>Well, we just finished our clinical data wrangling workshop. This was a 12 hour workshop (spread over 4 days) where students got to work with a real research dataset (the Sleep Heart Health Study data). This is a workshop that we developed as part of an National Library of Medicine T15 training supplement in Data Science. The following is a short report describing the workshop and its outcomes.
Intended AudienceWe designed the workshop for our incoming informatics students (both clinical and biological majors) in order to introduce them to the difficulties of working with clinical data.</description>

      <description>Note: sometimes I write these posts to teach myself a better way to do things in R.
I have been avoiding tidyeval somewhat, because I seem to have a bit of a learning block about it. I’m going to try to write some posts that help me understand what’s going on with Tidy Evaluation.
Using sym() in a Shiny AppOne fairly simple Shiny Application might be selecting a column of the dataset and then doing something with it, such as using it in a select() or filter() statement.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still in the process of recovering from my current bout of depression and anxiety. I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about what is currently helping me moderate my anxiety. I have been practicing mindfulness and meditation for the past three years and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to realize how necessary it is in our information dense age. Many of my symptoms of anxiety are really from an information overglut.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently on way too many projects and am teaching as well.</description>

      <description>I decided to write this post in celebration of my newest album, [Tiny Fugues, being released](). I consider myself a scientist and I am a musician in almost equal parts. There has been a lot of talking about the role of creativity in science. Honestly, I rarely try to cross the streams of science and music, mostly because it really hasn&amp;rsquo;t been encouraged in my career.
I do think that I do use the same problem solving skills that I do in science that I also use in composition.</description>

      <description>I want to thank everyone who has reached out to me after I wrote my post on struggling with my depression and self-care. I am incredibly grateful for everyone’s concern about me. I wrote that at a low point in my life because I had to. I was suffering too long in silence, and I needed to do something. Writing that post was incredibly scary. I am still worried that it may be used against me somehow down the line when I am reviewed for tenure.</description>

      <description>Motivation A few weeks ago, as part of the [rOpenSci Unconference](), a group of us (Sean Hughes, Malisa Smith, Angela Li, Ju Kim and me) decided to work on making the UMAP algorithm accessible within R. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a [dimensionality reduction technique]() that allows the user to reduce high dimensional data (multiple columns) into a smaller number of columns for visualization purposes (Usually two). It is related to both Priniciple Components Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE, which are techniques often used in the single-cell omics world to visualize high dimensional data.</description>

      <description>Well, Cascadia-R 2018 has come and gone. This year we tried our best to make it as inclusive, welcoming, and friendly as we could. Considering we had 224 participants this time around, I’d say it was a success.
I just thought I would do a little write up of some of the things we did and why we did them in our conference. I’m hoping it will be useful for other conference planners to create a welcoming environment.</description>

 I have to confess that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been feeling all that well the past few months. Right now I am plagued with feelings that I am doing my work as an Assistant Professor wrong.</description>

      <description>Even though I’ve been using the tidyverse for a couple of years, there’s always a couple new applications of tidyverse verbs.
This one, in retrospect, is pretty simple. I had a one to many table that I wanted to collapse, tidy-style. Let’s look at the diamonds dataset:
diamonds %&amp;gt;% select(color, cut)## # A tibble: 53,940 x 2## color cut ## &amp;lt;ord&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ord&amp;gt; ## 1 E Ideal ## 2 E Premium ## 3 E Good ## 4 I Premium ## 5 J Good ## 6 J Very Good## 7 I Very Good## 8 H Very Good## 9 E Fair ## 10 H Very Good## # .</description>

      <description>In academia, it’s inevitable to have to travel and present at conferences and meetings. As an introvert, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to compile a few tips that have helped me navigate large conferences so I don’t feel overwhelmed.
It is unfortunate that though the academic community has many introverts, conference and meeting structure is heavily biased towards extroverts. (No offense to extroverts, but some of you can sometimes seem like blowhards to us introverts.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the lack of posts. I have been busy with co-teaching our Health Informatics course (HSMP410) for the OHSU/PSU School of Public Health.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make most of my lectures activity-driven for my students, who are Community Health Education and Nursing majors. I believe that you can teach mathematical concepts visually, so I am experimenting with using LearnR/Shiny to teach the basics of data literacy. I&amp;rsquo;m also using datacamp-light to show my students a simple intro to data science.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re trying to give students a feel for what informatics is about in an accessible way.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make the lectures as understandable as I can. This week we tackled Genome Wide Association Studies and discussed the strength of evidence behind SNP variants associated with phenotypes.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the good fortune to attend the From Evidence to Scholarship Conference at my alma mater, Reed College. The focus of the conference was improving the research process for undergraduates using digital scholarship. I came away from it excited about the work other people are doing in this realm and thinking about ways we could adapt these approaches.
Nicole Vasilevsky and I (both former Reedies) each gave talks, about our experience developing materials for Data Science and giving data science workshops to undergraduates.</description>

      <description>I gave a talk for the Portland State University Systems Science seminar called How are Data Science and Systems Science Connected?. In this talk, I was highlighting current blind spots in Data Science that I think Systems Science approaches can address, especially that of interactions between features. I talked a little about my dissertation research (surrogate oncogenes), and the problem of black-box interpretability of predictive models.

We had 10 people attend, and most of the attendees managed to get through the material and had lots of good questions. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and I hope everyone learned something. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to give the workshop again to the larger PDX R user community, and some of the attendees last night have volunteered to be TAs.</description>

  I have had many people who have asked me for informational interviews. They tell me that they are interested in Data Science and want to hear about what I do on a day to day basis.</description>

      <description>Note: after posting this, I heard back from Roberto Tyley, the creator of the BFG. I&amp;rsquo;d like to note that the BFG actually does its job really well. I was mostly really frustrated about how Git/GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent a user from doing something that&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. So my frustration is really about that, not really about the BFG. This post has been edited to reflect that.
Greg Wilson first said it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to agree.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had something that no matter how many times someone explained it, you really had no idea what it was for? For me, that was Non Standard Evaluation (NSE) in R, and its newer cousin Tidy Evaluation, or tidyeval. I had a real learning block about it. I really wanted to understand it, but for some reason I just really wasn’t getting the general concepts.
What is evaluation, really?</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone, our paper called Teaching data science fundamentals through realistic synthetic clinical cardiovascular data is now available to read on Biorxiv.
In this paper, we talk about a dataset that we synthesized for teaching aspects of clinical data that may be tricky to understand in data science. This dataset is interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.</description>

      <description>I just came back from the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) in San Francisco and I found it really stimulating and interesting. I learned a ton, met some great people working in very different fields, and overall found it quite worthwhile.
Here are some of the highlights from my notes:
Workshops scikit-learn intro Workshop and Advanced
I admit that I am not really a Python person. But I am helping to develop some materials for an introductory workshop and I found this workshop and its materials to be a very beginner-friendly to scikit-learn and machine learning concepts, much like caret for R.</description>

      <description>One of the hardest concepts as an analyst that I have struggled with is separating my code from my data. A related issue is making your code reproducible across data instances.</description>

      <title>How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a talk for the PDX RLang Meetup on July 11 called &amp;ldquo;How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data: Teaching EDA using Shiny&amp;rdquo;. Abstract below.
Many graduate students in the basic sciences are afraid of data exploration and cleaning, which can greatly impact their downstream analysis results. By using a synthetic dataset, some simple dplyr commands, and a shiny dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units).</description>

      <title>Some Lessons We Learned Running Cascadia-R</title>
      <link>/2017/06/07/cascadiarnotes/</link>

      <description>Well, the first Cascadia R Conference has come and gone. I have to say that it was super fun, and well attended (over 190 people!). I had a blast meeting and chatting with everyone. Hopefully, we showed newbies that R is learnable and others that there are lots more things to learn about R.
The following is my attempt to document what we learned from organizing Cascadia-R. It&amp;rsquo;s not complete; I may add and subtract from it as I think of more things to say about the planning process.</description>

      <title>On Breadth and Depth in Your Academic Career</title>
      <link>/2017/04/19/breadth-and-depth/</link>

      <guid>/2017/04/19/breadth-and-depth/</guid>
      <description>I was talking with a student and they were complaining that when at conferences, they would try to inject other topics of interest (such as cooking) into discussions with colleagues. Unfortunately, one of the after effects of this was that they were looked at as &amp;ldquo;not a serious scientist&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s an expectation that a scientist must be all depth, only talking and thinking about their sub-field.
As a cross disciplinarian, I have to say that is hogwash.</description>

      <title>Fostering a Peer Mentoring Culture</title>

      <description>I realize that it has been an embarrasingly long time since I updated this blog. I had all sorts of grandiose plans for it, and I think my problem was that I was thinking too broad, too pie-in-the-sky. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to focus on short and informative blog posts.
One of the things that I have been thinking about graduate school is the idea of building a Peer Mentoring culture in our department.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Oncogene Paper is Published</title>
      <link>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</link>

      <guid>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</guid>
      <description>My dissertation paper, A Network-Based Model of Oncogenic Collaboration for Prediction of Drug Sensitivity is now published! Here&amp;rsquo;s a lay summary:
 One outstanding issue in analyzing genomics in the context of personalized medicine is the incorporation of rare or infrequent genetic alterations (copy number alterations and somatic mutations) that are observed in individual &amp;gt; patients. We hypothesize that these mutations may actually &amp;lsquo;collaborate&amp;rsquo; with known oncogenes in the genesis of tumors through their interactions.</description>

      <title>Why Short-Order Bioinformatics Doesn&#39;t Work</title>
      <link>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</link>

      <guid>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</guid>
      <description>Unfortunately, many researchers look at computational biology and bioinformatics as a black-box: you put in data, and you get results out. The bioinformaticians and computational biologists are seen as mostly computer operators who push the button and not as true collaborators. One of my co-workers calls this &amp;ldquo;short-order&amp;rdquo; bioinformatics.
There is great danger in simply pushing a button to get results. One type of analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is highly dependent on how mutations are incorporated into a gene set.</description>

      <title>Interesting interview with the developer of statcheck</title>

      <description>Due to the usual postdoc busy-ness, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the energy to update this blog as much as I would like, but I thought this interview on Retraction Watch from Michèle B. Nuijten, the developer of the R-package statcheck to be fascinating. Her package essentially automates the checking of p-values given published data in papers, from converting the papers from pdf to text, and sees if the calculated p-values are correct.</description>

      <title>Somatic Mutations in Skin Paper</title>
      <link>/2015/05/26/mutational-burden-in-skin/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2015/05/26/mutational-burden-in-skin/</guid>
      <description>This paper, High burden and pervasive positive selection of somatic mutations in normal human skin is fascinating. It suggests that the mutational burden is much higher than we expected in skin cells due to UV exposure. In addition, subclones exist in the skin that are positively selected for oncogenes.
It also makes me want to stock up on sunscreen.</description>

      <title>High Impact Factor Journals Have Higher Retraction Rates</title>
      <link>/2015/05/24/the-rise-of-fraud-in-high-if-journals/</link>

      <guid>/2015/05/24/the-rise-of-fraud-in-high-if-journals/</guid>
      <description>Very interesting New York Times article about the rise of frauds and retractions in High Impact Factor journals. The retraction rates for High IF journals (such as Science, Cell, and Nature) are much higher than lower IF journals.
From the article:
 Journals with higher impact factors retract papers more often than those with lower impact factors. It’s not clear why. It could be that these prominent periodicals have more, and more careful, readers, who notice mistakes.</description>
